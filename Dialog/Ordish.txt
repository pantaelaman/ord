		[GRANNY right laugh]
		Funny how we get attached to the struggle.

		Welcome back.

		[THEO right excited]
		{+MADELINE}!
		Did you make it to the summit?
		
		{trigger 0 Badeline emerges}

		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah, we did.
		It was incredible.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Beautiful, isn't it?

		[BADELINE left upset]
		I didn't think it would be worth it...

		[BADELINE left normal]
		But it totally was.

		[THEO right thinking]
		I should've given you my phone so{n}you could take {~}The Ultimate Selfie.{/~}

		{trigger 1 Fade out, hear knock on door, fade in and Oshiro enters}

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		Good evening, everyone.

		[BADELINE right angry]
		What are {~}you{/~} doing here?

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		A little bird told me there was to be a party.

		[OSHIRO left sidehappy]
		{+thought}RSVP-by-bird, positively magical!{+endthought}

		[OSHIRO left drama]
		But if I am unwelcome, I shall take my leave.

		[MADELINE right sad]
		Please stay, {+MROSHIRO}.

		[MADELINE right normal]
		It's good to see you.

		{trigger 2 Oshiro settles in}

		[GRANNY left normal]
		Y'know, this is the first time I've seen{n}you outside that hotel of yours, {+OSHIRO}.
		I'm glad you made it.
		{+MADELINE} here is baking us a pie with all{n}of the strawberries she's been collecting.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		Oh, that's wonderful, {+MS_MADELINE}.

		[THEO right normal]
		I haven't had {# F94A4A}strawberry pie{#} since I was a kid.

		[THEO right excited]
		This is gonna be amazing!

		[BADELINE right scoff]
		Don't get your hopes up, she's not much of a baker.

		{trigger 3 Maddy Turns}

		[MADELINE left normal]
		You also said I wasn't a mountain climber.

		[BADELINE right worried]
		True.

		{trigger 3 Maddy Turns}

		[MADELINE right sad]
		I can't promise it'll live up to the hype, {+THEO}.

		[MADELINE right normal]
		But I tried my best.

	EP_PIE_START=
		[MADELINE right normal]
		So?
		How's it taste?

	EP_PIE_DISAPPOINTED=
		[THEO left wtf]
		I guess this is technically a pie...

		[OSHIRO left worried]
		Is this some kind of joke, {+MS_MADELINE}?

		[GRANNY left normal]
		Strawberry pies are supposed to{n}have strawberries in them, dear.

	EP_PIE_GROSSED_OUT=
		[THEO left wtf]
		{+MADELINE}, I super appreciate you baking for us...
		But I don't think I can eat this.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		It's the thought that counts.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		You people just can't appreciate good food.
		I'll eat all of it myself.

		[MADELINE right sad]
		You don't have to do that.

		[BADELINE left worried]
		Yeah... it was an empty threat.

	EP_PIE_OKAY=
		[OSHIRO left normal]
		The important thing is that you{n}tried your best, {+MS_MADELINE}.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		Who invited this guy?

		[THEO left thinking]
		Come on, it's really good.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		I've certainly had worse.

		[THEO left normal]
		Thanks for the pie, {+MADELINE}.

	EP_PIE_REALLY_GOOD=
		[GRANNY left normal]
		I'm impressed!
		This gives my baking a run for its money.

		[BADELINE left normal]
		Not bad.

		[THEO left excited]
		Holy crap!

		[THEO left normal]
		This is so tasty.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		{+MS_MADELINE}, are you available to{n}cater our re-opening banquet?
		
		[THEO left excited]
		Can I take a slice home for {+ALEX}?
		She'll die when she tastes this.
		
	EP_PIE_AMAZING=
		[THEO left wtf]
		{+MADELINE}.

		[THEO left excited]
		This is the best thing I've ever tasted!

		[MADELINE right sad]
		Come on. Be honest.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		He's right, dear.
		This is delicious.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		It's truly magnificent, {+MS_MADELINE}.

		[OSHIRO left worried]
		{~}A symphony for the taste buds!{/~}

		[BADELINE left scoff]
		Can I take partial credit for this?

		[MADELINE right normal]
		Wow, thanks everyone.
		I worked really hard for it.
		
# *** Appendix ***

	APP_INTRO=
		About a year later...

	APP_OLDLADY_A=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Hey there, kiddo!
		Nice to see you again.

		{trigger 0}

		[GRANNY right normal flip]
		Here's the cave I told you about{n}on the phone.
		
		{silent_trigger 1}
		
		Follow me.

	APP_OLDLADY_B=
		[MADELINE left sad]
		What is this place?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		This passage leads to the center of the {+MOUNTAIN}.
		You said you wanted to come{n}back and explore deeper...

		{trigger 0 start laughing}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		Doesn't get any deeper than this!

		{trigger 1 stop laughing}

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Be careful, though.
		When you get this close to the heart of the {+MOUNTAIN},{n}its power will start affectin' you differently.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Yeah, I already noticed some of that...

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Good luck in there.

	APP_OLDLADY_C=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Where's that other {+PART_OF_YOU}?

		[MADELINE left sad]
		I don't know... I expected her to show up by now.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		Maybe I've changed, and{n}she's not {+PART_OF_ME} anymore.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Or maybe you've grown together.
		Maybe it's not so easy for the{n}{+MOUNTAIN} to separate you now.
		I'd wager she's still with you, in some form.

		[MADELINE left normal]
		I like that theory better.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I still wish I could talk to her though.

	APP_OLDLADY_D=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Do you keep in touch with {+THEO}?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah, he spent the summer in Vancouver.
		We got to spend some quality time together.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		What's he up to these days?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		He's back in California with his family now.
		He wants to be around while{n}his sister finishes law school.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		It sounds pretty intense, but he{n}wants to be there to support her.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		He seems like a nice young man.

	APP_OLDLADY_E=
		[MADELINE left normal]
		It's been a while. How've you been?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Oh, same old same old.

		{trigger 0 start laughing}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		And in my case, that's pretty old.

		{trigger 1 end laughing}

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I'm not gettin' any younger, that's for sure.
		Some days, just keeping the{n}lights on can take all my energy.
		The {+MOUNTAIN} still keeps me sharp, though.

		[GRANNY right mock]
		I'm not ready to give up the ghost anytime soon.

		[MADELINE left normal]
		I'd expect no less from you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Take care of yourself.

	APP_OLDLADY_LOCKED=
		[MADELINE left sad]
		That door up ahead won't budge.
		Is there another way in?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I'm afraid not, dear.

		[GRANNY right mock]
		You think the {+MOUNTAIN} is gonna{n}start going easy on you now?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I guess it doesn't think you're ready yet.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Okay, {+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} might be {~}weird and magical.{/~}

		[MADELINE left upset]
		But now you're telling me it can {~}"think",{/~} too?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		It doesn't think like you or me.
		It's like... how a river thinks to flow to the sea.
		You can make it sound crazy if you want.

		[MADELINE left upset]
		I know better than to doubt you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		How do I convince it I'm ready?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Heck if I know.
		I'd retrace my steps, and really pay attention.
		{+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} must have more to teach you.

	APP_ENDING=
		...this is it?
		This is what's at the center of all of this?
		It's so empty... and vast...
		Yet it feels nostalgic somehow.
		And peaceful.

		{+GRANNY}...
		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I can't believe you're gone, you old bat.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		Well,{0.2} I guess I can.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		It sounded like you were saying goodbye{n}in the last letter you sent me.

		{silent_trigger 0 Step Forward}
		
		[MADELINE left sadder]
		This isn't fair. I need you.

		[MADELINE left angry]
		You didn't prepare me for any of this.

		{trigger 1 Badeline Appears}

		[BADELINE left scoff]
		What do you want her to do, apologize?

		[BADELINE left upset]
		She's gone.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		And you didn't even go to the funeral.

		{trigger 2 Sit Down}

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I know, I just... couldn't.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I fell apart.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I'm so sorry, {+GRANNY}.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		{~}Sorry{/~} won't bring her back.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		You're right.

		It was selfish of me to come here.

		[BADELINE right concerned]
		Where are we going, {+MADELINE}?

		[MADELINE left sad]
		We have to follow that bird.
		It's {+PART_OF_GRANNY}, just like you're {+PART_OF_ME}.
    
		[BADELINE right worried]
		I thought it was just her pet or something...

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		It {~}has{/~} to be more than that.

		That bird was always looking out for me{n}on the {+MOUNTAIN}, just like {+GRANNY} did.

		{+MADELINE}... I hate to say it, but...

		You're in denial.

		Uh... we're really high up.

		[BADELINE left worried]
		We should really turn back.

		[MADELINE right upset]
		We don't have time to argue about this.

		[BADELINE left concerned]
		How are you even breathing up here?

		[MADELINE right sad]
		{+GRANNY} wants us to follow her.

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		We can't let her down again.

		[BADELINE left angryAlt]
		{~}...it's a bird,{/~} {+MADELINE}.

		You {*}really{/*} think that's just a regular bird?

		It's {+PART_OF_HER}, and it's still here somehow.

		I have to do... something.
